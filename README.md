My name is George, but you can call me Felix.

I am currently a student programming for fun but I am hoping in the future to take on a job somewhere in the computer science field.
I mainly write code in `C++` but I know some `Python` and am hoping to start learning `Rust` soon (when I feel experienced enough with `C++`).
The main fields I would like to work in in the future include game development, data management, machine learning and maybe backend web development (**NOT `javascript`**).

Most of my projects will be _ _completely_ _ open source and free for usage, so do whatever you want with them.
My main goal of this account is to provide tools for other programmers in order to make things easier and to speed up the development process.

If you want to collaborate with me on something (hopefully in `C++`), please feel free to get in touch!
